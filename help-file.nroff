.TH KEEPAWAKE 1
.SH NAME
keepawake \- Keeps the system awake \- higher\-level than 'caffeinate'
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B keepawake
[\fIoptions\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBkeepawake\fR will keep the system awake for a specified duration
of time, during which it will every second output a line displaying
the hours, minutes, and seconds remaining.

After it completes this countdown, it will ring
a bell every three seconds (also for
a specified amount of time) and continue to keep the system awake
while it does so.
At first, the bell will be at a very quiet, barely\-audible volume
(0.1% of the maximum volume) \- but the volume will gradually
increase (each ring
being 102% the volume of the previous one) until either the specified
amount of bell\-ringing time has elapsed or until the maximum bell
volume has been reached.

Each time \fBkeepawake\fR rings the bell, it will output a line
specifying how long it has been since the initial countdown period
has ended as well as the volume of the bell on a scale of 0 being
absolute silence and 1 being the maximum volume.
.SH OPTIONS
The options are processed in the order that they appear on the command line.
Each option overrides any earlier option to it's contrary.
.TP
.BR \-\-help
Displays this help file.
If this option is invoked, the program will do nothing \fIexcept\fR
display the help file.

It should be noted that while this help\-file is written in the
format of a \fBman\fR page, it's package does not actually
\fIinstall\fR this help\-file as a \fBman\fR page.
.TP
.BR -pfx " " <\fItext\fR>
The specified text will be prepended to each line of output
\- in both phases.
.TP
.BR -ori " " <\fIvol\fR>
Sets the starting volume of the bell - 100 being the maximum
value.
.TP
.BR -scr
When the system is kept awake, the display will be kept
awake as well.
(This is the default behavior of the program but can be
overridden by the \fB\-xscr\fR option.)
.TP
.BR -max " " <\fIvol\fR>
Sets the maximum volume to which the ringing at the end
can increase - on a scale of 0 to 100.
The default is 100.
.TP
.BR -rate " " <\fIrate\fR>
Sets the percentage that the volume of the ring will increase
with each repetition from the time it starts (after the
initial countdown) to whenever it reaches the maximum volume
or is interrupted by the user. Must be a value from 0 to 100.
The default is 2.
.TP
.BR -tm " " <\fIminutes\fR> " "  <\fIseconds\fR>
Sets the duration of this program's countdown period.
The default is ten minutes.
.TP
.BR -tma " "  <\fIminutes\fR> " "  <\fIseconds\fR>
Sets the duration of the bell-ringing period after his
program's countdown period.
The default is twenty minutes.
.TP
.BR -tmh " " <\fIhours\fR> " " <\fIminutes\fR> " "  <\fIseconds\fR>
Sets the duration of this program's countdown period.
The default is ten minutes.
.TP
.BR -u
Turns off the feature of the bell\-ringing stopping after a certain
amount of time \- instead switching the program to an aberrant
mode in which the bell\-ringing continues indefinitely.
If this option is invoked, the default can be restored via
the \fB\-xu\fR option.

The developer of this program can not foresee any scenario
in which use of the \fB\-u\fR option is advisable \- yet it
is included nonetheless just in case the user is found in
just such a scenario that is unforeseen by the developer.
.TP
.BR -wf " " <\fIfile\fR> " " <\fIcontent\fR>
The program will only run so long as the file \fIfile\fR
exists and it's contents are \fIcontent\fR.

If the final character of the file's actual content happens
to be a newline character, that character will be removed
before it is compared with the \fIcontent\fR argument.
This is because this option is written with one-line files
in mind (though, aside from this measure, does nothing to
enforce it).

For the time being, a properly formatted command-line
of this utility will only invoke this option once.
This is to prevent incompatibilities in the future when
support for multiple condition-files is added.
.TP
.BR \-xscr
The system will still be kept awake for the run of the command \-
but the display will not.
(The default behavior of this program keeps the display awake as well
as the rest of the system. To restore the default behavior, use
the \fB\-scr\fR option later in the command line.)
.TP
.BR \-xu
This option overrides the \fB\-u\fR option \- restoring the program's
default behavior of terminating after a certain amount of time has
passed during it's bell\-ringing phase.
Overrides the \fB
